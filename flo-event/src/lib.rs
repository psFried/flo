//! This crate defines the common types that form the basic building blocks of flo, events.
//! An Event is exactly what it sounds like. Semantically, it describes something that _happened_. Events are fundamentally
//! different than typical _domain objects_, which are focused on _state_.
//!
//! Events are also persistent. Many consumers can _consume_ the same event, and a single consumer can even go back and
//! read the same event multiple times if it chooses to. This makes an event stream much more efficient that queue-based
//! topics in situations with many consumers.
//!
//! Flo allows each event to declare a namespace. By convention, the namespaces of events describe the hierarchy within the
//! domain. Consider the example of modeling the operations in a restaurant. The namespaces in your domain might look
//! something like:
//!
//! <pre>
//! restaurant/
//!    ├── dining-room
//!    │   ├── bar
//!    │   └── tables
//!    │       ├── 1
//!    │       ├── 2
//!    │       └── 3
//!    ├── kitchen
//!    │   ├── dishwasher
//!    │   ├── fridge
//!    │   └── oven
//!    └── staff
//!        ├── Jen
//!        └── Robbie
//! </pre>
//! So, an event pertaining to the dishwasher would be in the namespace `/restaurant/kitchen/dishwasher`, while an event
//! related just to table 1 would be in `/restaurant/dining-room/tables/1`. If a consumer was interested in events
//! related to _all tables_, then they would read events from `/restaurant/dining-room/tables/*`, or if they were interested
//! in all events in the dining room, whether at a table or at the bar, they could consume events from
//! `/restaurant/dining-room/**/*`. This allows application services to be appropriately scoped, while still giving then
//! the freedom to cross-cut concerns. For instance, we might want to deploy a monitoring service to collect performance
//! statistics on the entire system. That monitoring service would surely want to get every event, so could read events
//! from `/**/*`.
//!
